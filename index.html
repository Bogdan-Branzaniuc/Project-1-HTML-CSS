            <h1>Why Nuclear Fusion?</h1>
            <p>The bigger the problem one technology solves, the bigger the overall interest in it, thus the faster it
                travels out of the lab through industry and bright minds of great engineers. </p>
            <p>And finally landing in our day to day lives, allowing us to solve different problems down the road of
                Human Kind</p>

            <h2>Fusion</h2>
            <p>Fusion is achieved by heating and maintaingin a plasma at extreme temperatures and density, where the
                atoms are loosing their electrons and start coliding with each other creating a heavier element. </p>
            <p>As a result of this process, energy is released up to 4 milion times more than burning the same quantity
                of fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>The best example of Fusion Reaction is our Sun.</p>
            <p>Due to it’s mass and gravity, the necessary density and temperature allows for Nuclear Fusion to occur.

    <section id="fision-explained">
        <div>
            <h2>Fision</h2>
            <p>In a Fission reaction, we are looking at a bigger atom that gets split into two or more smaller nuclei by
                a proton traveling at an imense speed.</p>
            <p>This process generates further high velocity protons, creating a chain reaction that needs to be
                maintained. </p>
            <p>Splitting the atom generates an incredible amount of energy. </p>
            <p>Unlike Fusion, Fission requires a bigger responsibility and risk, more safety measures, and nculear waste
                gets created</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Fusion efficency</h2>
            <p>On 21 December 2021 Joint European Tours (JET) had an output of 59 megajoules. The fusion reactor
                produced around <strong>11 Megawatts over 5 seconds.</strong> </p>
            <p>If this energy would have been harvested, the total stored energy would be around 4MW</p>
            <p>However In total, when JET runs, it consumes <strong>700 to 800 MW</strong> of electrical power (the
                equivalent of 1-2% of the UK's total electricity usage).</p>
            <p>This is to say that there’s still a long way to go, </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Energy Storage</h2>
            <p>By achieving a big amount of energy we need better ways of storing it. </p>
            <p>When using the word “battery” there's a common practice of thinking of the well known lithiun-ion cells,
                but there are much better ways to store titanic amounts of energy, and by using the same word “battery”
                for this processes, we are not wrong at all. </p>
            <p>In fact, storing energy and releasing it on demand is all that a battery is. </p>
