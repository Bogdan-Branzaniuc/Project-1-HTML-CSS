![](assets/img/dropdown-menu-under-1200px.jpg)
- bellow 1200px width of the window, the nav-bar-menu displays a bar-icon. 
- it is scaled 1.3 times when hovered or touched and a menu with the other page's titles appears and it will stay visible untill pressed again. 
- the current-page has it's button's text in the nav-bar bold <br>
**** I used JS code to make the bars-icon and menu possible, since when I tried using bootstrap and it was breaking other parts of the css code because of naming conflicts. ****



* ## Side-scrolling Navigation Bar

![](assets/img/side-scroll-menu.png)
- The scrolling menu is using JavaScript code to move the yellow slider acros the menu.
- It has icons acting as links to various sections of the page
- It is also using JS code to find the right distance between the icons, as the sections have different sizes, that gives the user a better idea of how the content ahead is structured  
- By hovering or tocuhing the icons , a short title of the anchored section appears. <br>

 ####  **when changing the screen orientation, the JS code is listening for the screen.orientation.onchange event to locally refresh the page, in order to deal with increasing height or width of the slider. This means the program wil only know the orientation is changed when the user uses the accelerometer of the phone or tablet by turning it. When manually resizing the browser, it currently requires a refresh of the page.**
