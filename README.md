# Nuclear Fusion

**This is a project that provides it's users with knowledge about Nuclear Fusion as follows:** <br>
* basic knowledge about the process of fusion
  - the way fusion works
  - the difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission
* in-depth knowledge about both fusion and fision
  - historical context
  - detailed procedures of both fision and fusion and types of nuclear reactors
* where do we stand in the present from a technological point of view
  - ongoing projects and mega-projects in the field of nuclear fusion 
* **major breakthrough's**, and why are they **major**
  - Understanding what is at stake
  - The incredible pace we need to mentain in research and inovation
  - results and discoveries achieved in this field
* speculative long-term future of Nuclear fusion
  - representing the potential scale and power this technology could reach in the future.

This website targets everybody on Planet Earth with modest knowledge of science who likes inovation, including myself, as I will be learning a lot along the way.
