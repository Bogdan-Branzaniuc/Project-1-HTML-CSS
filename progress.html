            <p>The EUROfusion roadmap forms the basis for the programmes of EUROfusion and Fusion for Energy and
                provides a clear and structured way forward to commercial energy from fusion.</p>
            <p>Since 2013, when the first version of the Roadmap was published, the European fusion community has
                made significant advances in many areas. These include successfully integrating tungsten into the
                tokamak wall, gaining a greatly advanced understanding of the material properties that will be
                required by ITER and DEMO, and completing the construction and operation of the Wendelstein 7-X
                stellarator.</p>

            <h1>WHAT IS A TOKAMAK?</h1>
            <p>Power plants today rely either on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, or renewable sources like wind or water.
                Whatever the energy source, the plants generate electricity by converting mechanical power, such as the
                rotation of a turbine, into electrical power. In a coal-fired steam station, the combustion of coal
                turns water into steam and the steam in turn drives turbine generators to produce electricity.</p>
            <p>The tokamak is an experimental machine designed to harness the energy of fusion. Inside a tokamak, the
                energy produced through the fusion of atoms is absorbed as heat in the walls of the vessel. Just like a
                conventional power plant, a fusion power plant will use this heat to produce steam and then electricity
                by way of turbines and generators.</p>
            <p>The heart of a tokamak is its doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber. Inside, under the influence of extreme heat
                and pressure, gaseous hydrogen fuel becomes a plasma—the very environment in which hydrogen atoms can be
                brought to fuse and yield energy. (You can read more on this particular state of matter here.) The
                charged particles of the plasma can be shaped and controlled by the massive magnetic coils placed around
                the vessel; physicists use this important property to confine the hot plasma away from the vessel walls.
                The term "tokamak" comes to us from a Russian acronym that stands for "toroidal chamber with magnetic
                coils."</p>
            <p>First developed by Soviet research in the late 1960s, the tokamak has been adopted around the world as
                the most promising configuration of magnetic fusion device. ITER will be the world's largest
                tokamak—twice the size of the largest machine currently in operation, with ten times the plasma chamber
                volume.</p>

            <h1>WHO IS PARTICIPATING?</h1>
            <p>The ITER Project is a globe-spanning collaboration of 35 nations.</p>
            <p>The ITER Members China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States have
                combined resources to conquer one of the greatest frontiers in science—reproducing on Earth the
                boundless energy that fuels the Sun and the stars.</p>
            <p>As signatories to the ITER Agreement, concluded in 2006, the seven Members will share of the cost of
                project construction, operation and decommissioning. They also share the experimental results and any
                intellectual property generated by the fabrication, construction and operation phases.</p>
            <p>Europe is responsible for the largest portion of construction costs (45.6 percent); the remainder is
                shared equally by China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US (9.1 percent each). The Members deliver
                very little monetary contribution to the project: instead, nine-tenths of contributions will be
                delivered to the ITER Organization in the form of completed components, systems or buildings.</p>
            <p>Taken together, the ITER Members represent three continents, over 40 languages, half of the world's
                population and 85 percent of global gross domestic product. In the offices of the ITER Organization and
                those of the seven Domestic Agencies, in laboratories and in industry, literally thousands of people are
                working toward the success of ITER.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper-column2" id="cooperation-agreements-text">
            <p>The ITER Organization has also concluded non-Member technical cooperation agreements with Australia
                (through the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, in 2016) and Kazakhstan
                (through Kazakhstan's National Nuclear Centre in 2017); a Memorandum of Understanding with Canada
                agreeing to explore the possibility of future cooperation and a Cooperation Agreement with the Thailand
                Institute of Nuclear Technology (2018); as well as over 70 Cooperation Agreements with international
                organizations, national laboratories, universities and schools.</p>

            <h1>WHEN WILL EXPERIMENTS BEGIN?</h1>
            <p>ITER's First Plasma is scheduled for December 2025.</p>
            <p>First Plasma will be the first time the machine is powered on, and the first act of ITER's multi-decade
                operational program. </p>
            <p>As signatories to the ITER Agreement, concluded in 2006, the seven Members will share of the cost of
                project construction, operation and decommissioning. They also share the experimental results and any
                intellectual property generated by the fabrication, construction and operation phases. </p>
            <p>The successful integration and assembly of over one million components (ten million parts), built in the
                ITER Members' factories around the world and delivered to the ITER site constitutes a tremendous
                logistics and engineering challenge. The ITER Organization will be carrying out the work supported by a
                number of assembly contractors (nine contracts in all). </p>
            <p>In November 2017, the project passed the halfway mark to First Plasma. (More here.) In July 2020, the
                project officially launched the machine assembly phase. (More here.) </p>
            <p>Throughout the ITER construction phase, the Council will closely monitor the performance of the ITER
                Organization and the Domestic Agencies through a series of high-level project milestones. See the
                Milestones page for a series of incremental milestones on the way to First Plasma.</p>
            <p>See these pages on the ITER web for more information on ITER construction and assembly. </p>
