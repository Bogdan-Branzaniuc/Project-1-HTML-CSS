            <p>This target comes with a time-pressure, as the fuel we are currently using will sooner or later reach
                it's

                    <h1>The road to fusion energy</h1>
                    <p>The EUROfusion roadmap forms the basis for the programmes of EUROfusion and Fusion for Energy and
                        provides a clear and structured way forward to commercial energy from fusion.</p>
                    <p>Since 2013, when the first version of the Roadmap was published, the European fusion community
                        has
                        made significant advances in many areas. These include successfully integrating tungsten into
                        the
                        tokamak wall, gaining a greatly advanced understanding of the material properties that will be
                        required by ITER and DEMO, and completing the construction and operation of the Wendelstein 7-X
                        stellarator.</p>

                    <h1>WHAT IS A TOKAMAK?</h1>
                    <p>Power plants today rely either on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, or renewable sources like wind
                        or
                        water.
                        Whatever the energy source, the plants generate electricity by converting mechanical power, such
                        as
                        the
                        rotation of a turbine, into electrical power. In a coal-fired steam station, the combustion of
                        coal
                        turns water into steam and the steam in turn drives turbine generators to produce electricity.
                    </p>
                    <p>The tokamak is an experimental machine designed to harness the energy of fusion. Inside a
                        tokamak,
                        the
                        energy produced through the fusion of atoms is absorbed as heat in the walls of the vessel. Just
                        like a
                        conventional power plant, a fusion power plant will use this heat to produce steam and then
                        electricity
                        by way of turbines and generators.</p>
                    <p>The heart of a tokamak is its doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber. Inside, under the influence of
                        extreme
                        heat
                        and pressure, gaseous hydrogen fuel becomes a plasma—the very environment in which hydrogen
                        atoms
                        can be
                        brought to fuse and yield energy. (You can read more on this particular state of matter here.)
                        The
                        charged particles of the plasma can be shaped and controlled by the massive magnetic coils
                        placed
                        around
                        the vessel; physicists use this important property to confine the hot plasma away from the
                        vessel
                        walls.
                        The term "tokamak" comes to us from a Russian acronym that stands for "toroidal chamber with
                        magnetic
                        coils."</p>
                    <p>First developed by Soviet research in the late 1960s, the tokamak has been adopted around the
                        world
                        as
                        the most promising configuration of magnetic fusion device. ITER will be the world's largest
                        tokamak—twice the size of the largest machine currently in operation, with ten times the plasma
                        chamber
                        volume.</p>

                    <h1>WHO IS PARTICIPATING?</h1>
                    <p>The ITER Project is a globe-spanning collaboration of 35 nations.</p>
                    <p>The ITER Members China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States
                        have
                        combined assets to conquer one of the greatest frontiers in science—reproducing on Earth the
                        boundless energy that fuels the Sun and the stars.</p>
                    <p>As signatories to the ITER Agreement, concluded in 2006, the seven Members will share of the cost
                        of
                        project construction, operation and decommissioning. They also share the experimental results
                        and
                        any
                        intellectual property generated by the fabrication, construction and operation phases.</p>
                    <p>Europe is responsible for the largest portion of construction costs (45.6 percent); the remainder
                        is
                        shared equally by China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US (9.1 percent each). The Members
                        deliver
                        very little monetary contribution to the project: instead, nine-tenths of contributions will be
                        delivered to the ITER Organization in the form of completed components, systems or buildings.
                    </p>
                    <p>Taken together, the ITER Members represent three continents, over 40 languages, half of the
                        world's
                        population and 85 percent of global gross domestic product. In the offices of the ITER
                        Organization
                        and
                        those of the seven Domestic Agencies, in laboratories and in industry, literally thousands of
                        people
                        are
                        working toward the success of ITER.</p>

                    <p>First Plasma will be the first time the machine is powered on, and the first act of ITER's
                        multi-decade
                        operational program. </p>

                        logistics and engineering challenge. The ITER Organization will be carrying out the work
                        supported
                        by a
                        number of assembly contractors (nine contracts in all). </p>
                    <p>In November 2017, the project passed the halfway mark to First Plasma. (More here.) In July 2020,
                        the
                        project officially launched the machine assembly phase. (More here.) </p>
                    <p>Throughout the ITER construction phase, the Council will closely monitor the performance of the

            <h1>II. JET</h1>
            <p><strong>The Joint European Torus</strong>, or JET, is an operational magnetically confined plasma
                physics experiment,
                located at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, UK. Based on a tokamak design, the fusion
                research facility is a joint European project with a main purpose of opening the way to future
                nuclear
                fusion grid energy. At the time of its design JET was larger than any comparable machine.

                <h1>ITER-like wall</h1>
                <p>In the past years, JET has been upgraded to become more ITER-like in order to conduct dedicated
                    studies for ITER. One main upgrade was to equip the vessel with an inner wall made of the same
                    materials planned for ITER - beryllium and tungsten. Together with upgraded heating power, this
                    ITER-like wall enables scientists to develop plasma scenarios that resemble as closely as
                    possible
                    those planned for ITER. Already JET experiments have helped ITER make the decision to begin
                    operation with a full tungsten divertor, thus substantially reducing investment costs.</p>

                <h1>ELM mitigation </h1>
                <p>In certain modes of operation fusion plasmas can develop potentially
                    harmful
                    instabilities. Examples
                    are disruptions, powerful events during which the plasma very rapidly loses all its energy, or
                    Edge
                    Localised Modes (ELMs), which are short plasma outbursts which thrust large heat and particle
                    loads
                    onto the vessel wall. In powerful devices like ITER such events are a potential risk for the
                    vessel
                    wall and must be mitigated. JET develops various methods to predict and mitigate these plasma
                    instabilities in ITER-like regimes of plasma operation.</p>

                <h1>D-T campaign</h1>
                <p>Deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas produce more fusion power and will therefore be the fuel for
                    fusion
                    power plants. ITER will carry out its ultimate experiments with D-T plasmas. Usually fusion
                    laboratories operate with D-D plasmas. JET is the only device operating that has been licensed
                    for
                    tritium. After a successful experimental campaign in 2015-2016 JET is currently preparing for
                    the
                    deuterium-tritium (DT) experiments in 2021.</p>

                    <p> Wendelstein 7-X is the world's largest fusion device of the stellarator type. Its objective is
                        to
                        investigate the suitability of this type for a power plant. It will test an optimised magnetic

                        magnet
                        coils, this being the technical core piece of the device. It is expected that plasma equilibrium
                        and
                        confinement will be of a quality comparable to that of a tokamak of the same size. But it will
                        avoid
                        the
                        disadvantages of a large current flowing in a tokamak plasma: With plasma discharges lasting up

                        30
                        minutes, Wendelstein 7-X is to demonstrate the essential stellarator property, viz. continuous

                    <h1>What is a Stellerator?</h1>
                    <h1>DOE Office of Science & Stellarators</h1>
                    <p> A stellarator is another type of a promising toroidal magnetic confinement device, very closely
                        related to the tokamak and only differing from it in how the confining magnetic field is
                        achieved.
                        Unlike the tokamak, which uses a combination of plasma current and TF coils, the stellarator
                        employs
                        helical coils.</p>
                    <p>The basic physical concept underlying the stellarator magnet system (MS) is very complex (see
                        Fig.
                        2.2A), while the requirement for its implementation accuracy is more demanding, than for the
                        tokamaks. In addition, at equal plasma volumes, a stellarator is larger than a tokamak. This
                        'initial disparity' allowed the tokamak to leave the stellarator behind in the race to fusion
                        energy. However, the tokamak's advantages are not overwhelming in terms of reactor design,
                        economics
                        and safety, and the stellarator may become a serious competitor. </p>

                    <p>It was a moment three years in the making, based on intensive research and design work:
                        On Sept.
                        5, for
                        the first time, a large high-temperature superconducting electromagnet was ramped up to
                        a field
                        strength
                        of 20 tesla, the most powerful magnetic field of its kind ever created on Earth. That
                        successful
                        demonstration helps resolve the greatest uncertainty in the quest to build the world's
                        first
                        fusion
                        power plant that can produce more power than it consumes, according to the project's
                        leaders at
                        MIT and
                        startup company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS).

            <h1>IV. Helion Energy Polaris</h1>
            <p> is an American fusion research company, located in Everett, Washington. The company focuses primarily
                on the production of low-cost-clean-electric energy and are working towards being the first commercial
                power plant that is derived exclusively from water. They are developing a magneto-inertial fusion
                technology to produce helium-3 and fusion power via aneutronic fusion</p>
            <p>The company's Fusion Engine technology is based on the Inductive Plasmoid Accelerator (IPA)
                experiments performed from 2005 through 2012. This system theoretically operates at 1 Hz,
                injecting plasma, compressing it to fusion conditions, expanding it, and directly recovering the energy
                to produce electricity. The IPA experiments claimed 300 km/s velocities, deuterium neutron
                production, and 2 keV deuterium ion temperatures. The pulsed-fusion system that is used is
                theoretically able to run 24/7 for electricity production. Due to its compact size, the systems are able
                to replace the current fossil fuel infrastructure without major needs for investment.</p>

            <h1>V. Other relevant Fusion Experiments </h1>
            <p>There is already a mini-galaxy of
                interest and knowledge in the Fusion Field. This magnificent potential is aproach by many bright people
                in
                many more ways than we could think of. The investments are astonishing big and they will keep growing
                over
                time.</p>
