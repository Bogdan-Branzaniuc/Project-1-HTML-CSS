            <h1>What is Fusion?</h1>
            <p> Nuclei of lighter atoms such as hydrogen collide and fuse together to produce nuclei of heavier atoms
                such as helium and release vast amounts of energy in the process -this is the essence of fusion. Because
                the energy is derived from the action of nuclei, fusion is a form of nuclear energy. It may be
                considered the opposite of fission, also a form of nuclear energy, which is generated when nuclei of
                heavy atoms split into lighter ones. Fusion is the process that powers and drives the production of
                energy in stars, such as our Sun.</p>

            <h1>Fusion on the Sun </h1>
            <p> The gravity of the Sun, which is almost 28 times that of Earth, ''traps'' hydrogen from its atmosphere
                and this hydrogen fuels the Sunâ€™s fusion reaction. At temperatures of 15 million degree Celcius in the
                Sun's core, hydrogen gas becomes plasma, the fourth state of matter. In a plasma, the negatively charged
                electrons in atoms are completely separated from the positively charged atomic nuclei (or ions). The
                Sun's gravitational force confines the positively-charged hydrogen nuclei and work with the high
                temperatures that cause the nuclei to move around furiously, collide at high speeds overcoming the
                natural electrostatic repulsion that exists between the positive charges and fuse to form the heavier
                helium.</p>

        <h1>From hydrogen to helium in three steps </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In the first stage two protons combine and one of them converts into a neutron to form a nucleus of
                the heavy isotope of hydrogen known as deuterium.
            </li>
            <li>Next, the deuterium nucleus combines with another proton to form the light helium isotope known as
                helium-3.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4, releasing two protons.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1>Energy release</h1>
            <p> Overall, four protons are converted into one helium nucleus. Energy is released because the helium
                nucleus has slightly less mass than the original four protons. The total amount of energy released
                for
                each conversion of four hydrogen nuclei into a helium nucleus is about 10 million times more than is
                produced by the chemical reaction when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water.</p>

            <h1>A Brief History of Fusion</h1>
            <p> Fusion is the most dominant reaction in our observable universe and it is the reaction that powers our
                Sun and the stars. However, the science and physics of nuclear fusion started becoming clear only in the
                1920s when British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington suggested that stars draw their energy from the
                fusion of hydrogen into helium. Eddington's theory was first published in 1926 in the Internal
                Constitution of the Stars, and this laid the foundation of modern theoretical astrophysics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1> Understanding the stars and the atom</h1>
            <p> Following Eddington's paper, Robert d'Escourt Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans provided the first
                calculations of the rate of nuclear fusion in stars. And at the same time, Ernest Rutherford was
                exploring the structure of the atom. With his famous 1934 experiment, Rutherford showed the fusion of
                deuterium into helium, and observed that "an enormous effect was produced" during the process. His
                student Mark Oliphant used an updated version of the equipment, firing deuterium rather than hydrogen
                and discovered helium-3 and tritium, showing that heavy hydrogen nuclei could be made to react with each
                other. This was the first direct demonstration of fusion in the lab. This understanding of nuclear
                fusion was tied together by Hans Bethe's work on stellar nucleosynthesis where he described that it is
                through proton-proton chain reactions that the Sun and stars release energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1> Enter the fusion machines</h1>
            <p> By the 1950s, researchers started looking at possibilities of replicating the process of nuclear fusion
                on Earth. And in 1950 soviet scientists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm proposed the design for a type of
                magnetic confinement fusion device, the tokamak. This was followed, in 1951, by Lyman Spitzer's concept
                for the stellarator. The stellarator concept dominated fusion research throughout the 1950s but lost its
                sway when the experimental research on tokamak systems by Soviet scientist Lev Artsimovich showed that
                the tokamak was a more efficient concept.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1> Designs on JET and beginnings for ITER</h1>
            <p> By the 1970s it was clear that attaining fusion energy would be one of science's greatest challenges and
                collaboration might be key to meeting the challenge. European countries came together and began design
                work on the Joint European Torus, JET, in 1973. In 1977, the European commission gave the green signal
                for the project and Culham in Oxford, UK, was selected as the site for JET. The construction of JET,
                which would become the largest operational magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment, was completed
                on time and on budget in 1983 and the first plasmas were achieved.
            </p>
            <p>The 80's also saw the iron curtain being lifted slightly when ITER was set in motion at the Geneva
                Superpower Summit in November 1985. The idea of a collaborative international project to develop fusion
                energy for peaceful purposes was proposed by General Secretary Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union to
                US President Reagan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1> JET record and a home for ITER</h1>
            <p> The first experiments using tritium was carried out in JET, making it the first reactor in the world to
                run on the fuel of a 50-50 mix of tritium and deuterium. In 1997, using this fuel, JET set the current
                world record for fusion output at 16 MW from an input of 24 MW of heating. This is also the world record
                for Q, at 0.67. A Q of 1 is breakeven, and to achieve fusion energy the Q value must be greater than 1.
                The aim of ITER is to achieve a Q of 10. In 2005, the ITER Members unanimously agreed that ITER would be
                built in Cadarache in France. In November 2017, the ITER project passed the 50 percent milestone of work
                scope completed to first plasma.
